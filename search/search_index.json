It is therefore equipped with six (6) non-steerable drive wheels, to facilitate design and reduce manufacturing costs. It is able to ride on sandy and rocky terrain and is capable of climbing obstacles of a certain size: 30cm Max, thanks to its structure type rocker-bogie, unlike the 4 wheels rovers.</p>"},{"location":"#feasibility-study","title":"Feasibility Study:","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Environmental constraints: It can withstand temperatures ranging from -25\u00b0C to 130\u00b0C (due to the L298N which has the lowest values in our assembly.) Electronic components are protected from water and dust, but the wheels must not pass through water because of the engines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technical constraints: it has a weight of 25Kg empty and is powered by two 12V batteries recovered from 2 Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) damaged. Communication and remote control are provided by a WIFI network, using the HTTPS protocol. Its dimensions are 36x32*85cm.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"electronics/","title":"Electronics","text":""},{"location":"electronics/#system-design","title":"System Design","text":""},{"location":"electronics/#synoptic-diagram","title":"Synoptic diagram","text":"<ul> <li>The heart of our rover is a webserver installed on a NodeMCU which communicates with the operator via its WIFI terminal, and assures the movements of the motors through the power interface.
